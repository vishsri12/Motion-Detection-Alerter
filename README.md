# 🚨 Motion Detection Alerter using ESP32

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Motion Detection Alerter** is an IoT-based security project developed using the **ESP32 DOIT DevKit V1** and simulated in **Wokwi**. The system detects motion using a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor and immediately turns on an LED while displaying an alert message on the Serial Monitor.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of IoT sensing, event detection, and real-time response, making it suitable for smart home security applications.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The ESP32 continuously monitors the PIR sensor.
2. When motion is detected, the PIR sensor outputs a HIGH signal.
3. The ESP32 reads the signal and turns ON the external LED.
4. A "Motion Detected!" message is displayed in the Serial Monitor.
5. When motion stops, the LED turns OFF and the Serial Monitor displays "No Motion".
